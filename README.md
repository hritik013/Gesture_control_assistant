Welcome to my Gesture Controlled Virtual Mouse project! This tool transforms the way you interact with your computer by letting you control your mouse and perform various actions using just your hand gestures and voice commands. No need for extra hardwareâ€”just your webcam and microphone are enough. The system uses advanced machine learning and computer vision techniques to recognize your gestures and voice, making everyday computer tasks more intuitive and touch-free.

With this project, you can move your cursor, click, scroll, drag and drop, adjust volume and brightness, and even use a built-in voice assistant for tasks like searching Google, navigating files, and more. Whether you want to boost productivity, improve accessibility, or just try something cool, this project is designed to be easy to use and fun to explore.

_Note: This project is optimized for Windows and Python 3.8.5._
